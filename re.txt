============= NOTES =============

1. nmap command used for probing test:
	probe service: nmap -sV -T4 localhost --version-intensity 6 -p 31000-32000
	probe opening ports: nmap localhost -p 31000-32000

2. openssl command used for ssh to a host
	openssl s_client --connect localhost:30001 [--quiet]

*** Install Ghidra ***

	1. Download JDK21 from https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=21 , extract, rename to jdk-21 and move to /opt/
	2. Use `update-alternatives` to configure java:
		1). Add java and javac by `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk-21/bin/java 1100` and `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/jdk-21/bin/javac 1100`
		2). Run java instance by `sudo update-alternatives --config java` and check by `java --version`
		Alternatively, configure the environment variables by adding these to `~/.bashrc`:
			```
			export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64" # Or your custom path like /opt/jdk-21
			export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
			```
		Note: `bash: /usr/bin/java: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` means the package is for a different architecture.
	3. Download release from github and tru `./ghidraRun`

*** Use Ghidra to debug ***
	
	1. Install gdb by `sudo apt install gdb`
	2. Verify the version of Python supported by GDB running 
		```
		$ gdb
		(gdb) python import sys
		(gdb) python print(sys.version)
		(gdb) quit
		```
	   Make sure the version is at least 3.7
	3. Install osutil and protobuf Python modules by `sudo apt install python3-psutil python3-protobuf`, can check by `apt list --installed | grep 'python3-psutil`
